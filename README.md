# 📊 FinNewsBot – AI-Powered Financial News Chatbot

FinNewsBot is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based chatbot that allows users to query **real-time financial news** and get AI-powered answers. It combines **LangChain, Chroma, and LLMs** with financial news feeds (RSS/HTML parsing) to deliver concise, relevant insights.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📡 Fetches **real-time financial news** using RSS feeds and BeautifulSoup.
* 🔎 Splits and embeds news articles using **LangChain embeddings**.
* 🗂️ Stores embeddings in **Chroma vector database**.
* 💬 Answers user queries using a **Retriever + LLM pipeline (RAG)**.
* ⚡ Built with **Groq/HuggingFace models**, optimized for speed and accuracy.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **LangChain** (document loading, text splitting, prompt engineering)
* **ChromaDB** (vector store)
* **Groq / HuggingFace embeddings**
* **Feedparser + BeautifulSoup** (news ingestion)

---

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * Parse financial news from RSS feeds using `feedparser` + `BeautifulSoup`.
2. **Preprocessing**

   * Convert news into LangChain `Document` objects.
   * Chunk text using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3. **Embeddings & Vector Store**

   * Generate embeddings using HuggingFace/Groq models.
   * Store vectors in ChromaDB.
4. **RAG Pipeline**

   * Build retriever + LLM chain with LangChain.
   * Use a custom prompt template for financial Q\&A.
5. **Query & Response**

   * User asks questions → Bot retrieves relevant news → LLM generates concise answers.

## 💻 Example Usage

```python
response = rag_chain.invoke(
    {"input": "What are the current hot topics in global financial markets?"}
)
print(response)
```

## 📌 Future Improvements

* 🌍 Add support for multiple news sources & APIs.
* 📊 Integrate financial data visualization.
* 🌐 Deploy on **Streamlit/Gradio** for an interactive UI.
* 🤖 Experiment with fine-tuned domain-specific LLMs.

👉 Do you want me to also create a **shorter “resume-ready description”** for GitHub (like 3–4 lines at the top), so recruiters can quickly understand the project without scrolling?
